INTRODUCTION
Hi there, do you have plans of switching into the tech industry, want to learn to code but dont know where to start from and need guidance, then this article is for you.In this tutorial series, we will be learning what software devvelopment is, types of software and how they are developed, tools and tutorials you will be needing to get started.At the end of this series, you should have a basic understanding of software development and the path to take in learning the type of software you choosed to develop.We will be using software/applications interchangeably hencefort.There are differnt types of applications as we will see later on in this article, we will be focusing on mobile and web application development in this series.
Series is in 3 parts. 


Part2 covers a detailed introduction of Web development.
Going through from web design (HTML , Css , Bootstrap , materialise , Foundation), To frontend Development (JS , React , Angular) , To backend developmment with NodeJS and Express.

Part3 covers a detailed introduction of  mobile application development for (Native , Hybrid) Java, Android , Swift , Ionic, React Native.

Without further ado*, lets get started.


WHAT IS SOFTWARE
First what is a software, a software is a collection of data or computer instructions that tell the computer how to work.(wikipedia).In most of the physical tech products we use, the physical tangible part is called the hardware.The non physical part that you see on the screen  and interact with or give voice commands to  like the music players on your phone, facebook , twitter, siri are software. The hardware houses  the software.


TYPES OF SOFTWARE/APPLICATIONS
The terms software is broad as there are different types of software depending on the criteria used in differentiating them.
Understanding the types of software will help you make a better decision of which  to learn and the skills neccessary for its developement.You can always learn how to develope the other types of software once you are comfortable with one.We will be categorising software based on the meduim they are used on.The types of applications are listed below

1-Web applications : All apps that are accessed via a URl in a browser or other clients.Eg Websites like Gmail.com, twitter.com
2-Mobile applications : Apps that are downloaded from the store and installed on the  mobile device.E.g(Twitter , Instagram app)
3-Desktop : Apps that are installed on your PC/Mac.E.g (MS Office , Corel Draw )



Now that we understand what software is and the types of software.Lets dive into how they are developed.



WHAT IS SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT
From Wikipedia 
"Software development is the process of conceiving, specifying, designing, programming, documenting, testing, and bug fixing involved in creating and maintaining applications, frameworks, or other software components. Software development is a process of writing and maintaining the source code, but in a broader sense, it includes all that is involved between the conception of the desired software through to the final manifestation of the software, sometimes in a planned and structured process.[1] Therefore, software development may include research, new development, prototyping, modification, reuse, re-engineering, maintenance, or any other activities that result in software products." 
We will be looking at the coding aspect of software development in this series.
From the above explanation we have an understanding that software developent involves using code to write instructions for the computer, these codes are written in programming languages that are human readable, the computer will compile or transform this codes to set of instructions it understands. 

Below are some of the terms we will be coming across when developing an application.

A programming language is a vocabulary and set of  rules for instructing a computer or computing device to perform specific tasks.We use these languages to create our applications.There are different types of programming languages, each withs its rules and commands to create task. 
Examples of programming languages are: Html , Javascript, Java, Swift, PHP etc.

(image example of a code).

An IDE(Integrated development enviroment) is the software used in writing the codes for your apps.Same way we use apps like ms word to create documents, we use IDE softwares to create apps.Basically it has a text/code editor where you write the code and other features to help  when creating an application.
Examples of IDE: VSCode , Jetbrains Webstorm , Android Studio, Xcode.

A Database is a structured set of data held in a computer, especially one that is accessible in various ways. Its the storage for the applications data.
Examples of database: Mysql , Sqlite, Oracle.
(image example of VScode with labels).

A server is a remote computer that houses your web applications(websites) and makes it accesible from anywhere.Web apps are uploaded to the server using FTP apps.If uploaded correctly and all required settings are accurate, your app will be accesible to other users.
(image showing server - db - client connection).

A client is the intended enviroment where your app will be used on.For mobile apps the client is the mobile device, for destop apps the client is the PC/Mac the app is installed on, for web apps the browser used in accessing the web page  is the client.

A quick prep talk before proceeding to the next post.
Learning software development can be nerve recking/challenging especially for beginners, below are of some tips/advice to have in mind while learning

 Tips and advice:
* Have a note where you jot your leanings, you can use a digital notebook live Keep / Evernote or a physical one.It helps in ......... (*check for importance of note keeping)

* Most terms wont be clear at first, try to go through them slowly until you understand.

* If you dont understand a term/concept after trying over, skip it and move to the next..Chances are you will understand it after you come back to it some other time.

* Expect to make little misatakes as it is common when starting out

* Try not to get overwhelmed or let  unfamiliar terms ditter you from learning.Always note any new terms and read up on them later.

* Be consistent

* Join a coding community : Foorloops , Freecodecamp etc

* When stucked on a problem, search on google, the chances that someone has a solution a very high online  Always search and learn about new terms when stucked

* Twitter
