INTRO TO SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT - Introduction(Part 1)
**Insert Cover Image**

Hi there, do you have plans of switching into the tech industry, want to learn to code but dont know where to start from and need guidance, then this article is for you.In this tutorial series, we will be learning what software devvelopment is, types of software and how they are developed, tools and tutorials you will be needing to get started.At the end of this series, you should have a basic understanding of software development and the path to take in learning the type of software you choosed to develop.We will be using software/applications interchangeably hencefort.There are differnt types of applications as we will see later on in this article, we will be focusing on mobile and web application development in this series.

This Series is in 3 parts. 

Part1 : Is this Post. The introduction

Part2 covers a detailed introduction of Web development,
going  through from web design (HTML , Css , Bootstrap , materialise , Foundation), To frontend Development (JS , React , Angular) and backend developmment with NodeJS and Express.

Part3 covers a detailed introduction to  mobile application development for Native Mobile Applications - Java, Android , Swift , Objective C and Hybrid Mobile Application - Ionic, React Native.

Without further ado, lets get started.

WHAT IS A SOFTWARE
First what is a software, a software is a collection of data or computer instructions that tell the computer how to work.(wikipedia).
In most of the physical tech products we use, the physical, tangible part is called the hardware.The non tangible part that you interact with via device screen, mouse or voice commands is the Software.There a different types of software depending on the task they perform, they range from  music applications like Spotify, to Social Media applications and websites like facebook and  twitter to Email Clients like Gmail, outlook and Productivity softwares like MS Word, Adobe Photoshop etc, the list is endless.


TYPES OF SOFTWARE/APPLICATIONS
The terms software is broad as there are different types of software depending on the criteria used in differentiating them.
Understanding the types of software will help you make a better decision of which  to learn and the skills neccessary for its developement.You can always learn how to develope the other types of software once you are comfortable with one.We will be categorising software based on the meduim they are used on.The types of applications are listed below:

1-Web applications : All apps that are accessed via a URl in a browser or other clients.Eg Websites like Gmail.com, twitter.com
2-Mobile applications : Apps that are downloaded from the store and installed on the  mobile device.E.g(Twitter , Instagram app)
3-Desktop : Apps that are installed on your PC/Mac.E.g (MS Office , Adobe Photoshop )



Now that we understand what software is and the types of software.Lets dive into how they are developed.

WHAT IS SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT

"Software development is the process of conceiving, specifying, designing, programming, documenting, testing, and bug fixing involved in creating and maintaining applications, frameworks, or other software components. Software development is a process of writing and maintaining the source code, but in a broader sense, it includes all that is involved between the conception of the desired software through to the final manifestation of the software, sometimes in a planned and structured process.[1] Therefore, software development may include research, new development, prototyping, modification, reuse, re-engineering, maintenance, or any other activities that result in software products." (Wikipedia)

That is a lot to take in, I know but dont let that deter you, once you get the basics that we will be covering in this series, learning and understanding the other aspects becomes easier.We will be looking at the coding aspect of software development in this series.
From the  explanation above, we have an understanding that software developent involves using codes to write instructions for the computer, these codes are written in programming languages that are human readable, the computer will compile or transform this codes to set of instructions it understands and perform the tasks stated in the code.


What do i need to get started:
One of the beautiful things about the software development community is that it doesn’t discriminate.
There are no barriers to entry and majorly aAll it takes is passion and the desire to learn and create.


Do I need a Computer Science or Engineering Degree before I can build applications : 
No you dont need a computer science degree or any degree for that matter to create applications,
with the free and paid tutorials available online, you will be  able to learn to code regardless of your background.I personally don’t have a CS degree along with countless other developers that I have worked with.

Do I need to know Advanced Mathematics before I can build applications : 
No, most programming languages and framworks have already done all the core mathematical computation under the hood to make software  creations easy. I hear this a lot as concerns from people starting out,so far you are good with basic mathematics you are good.




There a lot of new terms and Jargons in Software develoment like Object Orientend Programming, Encapsulation etc that you will be coming across as you learn, most of these terms have a simple explanation or a for simple concept once , as i have said before dont let new terms deter you, as a matter of fact embrace and rejoice whenever you come accross a new term as that is an oppurtunity to learn something new (smiles).
I will be explaining some of these terms below.

Programming Language:
A programming language is a vocabulary and set of  rules for instructing a computer or computing device to perform specific tasks.We use these languages to create our applications.There are different types of programming languages, each withs its rules and commands to create task. 
Examples of programming languages are: Html , Javascript, Java, Swift, PHP etc.

IDE(Integrated development enviroment)
An IDE(Integrated development enviroment) is the software used in writing the codes for your apps.Same way we use apps like ms word to create documents, we use IDE softwares to create apps.Basically it has a text/code editor where you write the code and other features to help  when creating an application.
Examples of IDE: VSCode , Sublime, Jetbrains Webstorm , Android Studio, Xcode.

A Database is a structured set of data held in a computer, especially one that is accessible in various ways. Its the storage for the applications data.
Examples of database: Mysql , Sqlite, Oracle.

A server is a remote computer that houses your web applications(websites, database and files) and makes it accesible from anywhere.Web apps are uploaded to the server using FTP apps.If uploaded correctly and all required settings are accurate, your web applications  will be accesible to other users.
**image showing server - db - client connection**.

A client is the intended enviroment where your app will be used on.For mobile apps the client is the mobile device, for destop apps the client is the PC/Mac the app is installed on, for web apps the browser used in accessing the web page  is the client.


A quick pep talk before proceeding to the next post.
Learning software development can be nerve recking/challenging in the beginning, especially if you are working in another field for a full time, below are of some tips/advice to have in mind while learning.

Advice

* Have a note where you jot your leanings, you can use a digital notebook like Keep/Evernote or a physical one.It helps  increase memorization and recollection of  information.

* Some new terms wont be clear at first, try to go through them slowly until you understand.

* If you dont understand a term/concept after trying over, skip it and move to the next, chances are you will understand it after you come back to it some other time.

* Expect to make little misatakes as it is common when starting out

* Try not to get overwhelmed or let  unfamiliar terms ditter you from learning.Always note  new terms you come across when leaning and read up on them later.

* But consistency is key. You’ll learn much more by coding for an hour every day, rather than spending seven hours coding on a weekend.

* Join a coding community : Foorloops , Freecodecamp, #100daysofcoding on twitter etc.

* Always seek for help either online or offline when stucked ,one of the cool thing in the coding community is  most of the more-experienced members  are willing to help, advise, and give their time for others.

* The best way to learn develoment is to  practice, ensure you pratice all you learn.You should  have a small project you work on and use what you learn to add features to it .Working on a pet project will also navigate  you into learning how to build the features you want to add to to your project.

* Read other peoples code to see how they build stuff, download free templates or open source code online.There are tons of (open source) projects, code snippets, and free libraries available that you can use to build your first projects. You can gain a lot of inspiration from looking at the work of others but ensure you learn from them and  understand how the code works.
