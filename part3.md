 Mobile applications are the applications that run on mobile phones and tablet.They required to be installed on mobile devices  before they can be used.

 Mobile apps have an advantage over web apps as they are able to access the device features like WIFI, Keyboard , Bluetooth etc.This gives developers more control and capabilities to add features using these access. There are approximately 10Billion**check for correct value** mobile apps on the ios and playstore combine and many more  are still being developed as of this moment.Mobile apps are dependent on the operating system to work, meaning a mobile app will only run on the operating system it is built for.

What is an operating System:
 An operating system is  the low-level software that supports a computer's basic functions, such as delicating  tasks and controlling the device hardware.
 It is also the link between the apps and the hardware and device features.
 If an app wants to open the camera, it will request  for the camera to be opened using the code provided by the os, the os will accept this request and
 enable the camera hardware.
 A mobile operating system is the OS running on a mobile device. There are quitea few mobile os, with Android by Google and IOS by apple being the most popular.



How to get started with mobile app developemnet:

Developing mobile apps is quite different from developing web apps because mobile apps depends on the operating system of the host device to work therefore  the development tools and langauge used in developing for android is different from that used for ios.Android apps are developed with the Java or Kotlin programming language, while IOS apps are developed uisng Swift(Recommended) or Objective C.
This means to publish a particular  app on the andrid playstore or apple appstore, you need to develop the app for  both platforms.This development method is refered to as Native application development.
Due to this rigidity, framworks  have been built to enable using one codebase to create apps for both os as agaianst writing different codes for them. This developmment method is refered to as Hybrid development method.

Hybrid Vs Native Mobile applications:

As explained above Native apps are apps built using the OS Native and recommended language and can only compile and run on the target OS, while Hybrid apps are built using a framework and the language recommended by the framwork.They can be compiled to run on multiple OS.Examples of popular Hybrid apps framwork are React Nativve built using Javascrpt , Ionic built using Javascript, Cordova built using Javascript, Xamarin built using c# etc.
It might be tempting to think using the Hybrid method to build apps is ideal, but that is not true for all kind of apps.For graphic intensive apps, Native is the way to go as its more responsive and fast. Basic non graphic intensive apps are ideal to be built using the Hybrid method. If you are familiar with HTML, Css and JS, i will recommend learning an Hybrid Framwork like RN or ionic since you have an understanding of the language used in developing them.
It's tedios to learn everything at once so for starters its advisable to pick one path either android, ios or hybrid ,understand and build a project with it.



 Android app development:

Native android apps are developed using Java or Kotlin programming language.They are developed using Android Studio IDE and are  published and distributed on  the google  playstore .

IOS app development:

Native ios apps are developed using Swift programming language.Formerly the recommende language is Objective C, and there are still apps built with objective C on the app store, but the recommend language now is Swift.They are developed using Xcode IDE and can only be developed on a mac pc.They are  published and didtributed on the apple appstore .

Hybrid app development:

Hybrid apps are developed using an Hybrid framework and its recommended programming language.    While you dont have to use the  native langauge  when developing hybrid apps you still need to have the native tools like andorid studio or xcode to be able to compile and publish them.The links below will aid your learning process.
